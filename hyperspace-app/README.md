# Hyperspace

A real-time multiplayer space shooter run on a scaling and auto healing Kontena cluster. An ongoing project that you can read more about on my blog [here](https://blog.mecloud.online).

The actual 80's style game is a fork from Ken Pratts repo: https://github.com/kenpratt/hyperspace

HEY IT WORKS, AND THEY ARE WATCHING ME JUDGING ME.
